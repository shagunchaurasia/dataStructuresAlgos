#### Challenge - Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a farcical "language" used to entertain children, but also to teach them some valuable language concepts along the way.  Translating English to Pig Latin is simple:

1) Take the first consonant (or cluster of consonants) of a word, move it to the end of the word, and add a suffix of "ay"
2) If a word begins with a vowel, just add "way" at the end
3) For the sake of readability, separate the Pig Latin-ized parts of the word with a dash `-`

Your challenge is to implement the method `pigLatinize` that takes a string phrase and translates it to Pig Latin. You're free to add additional classes, variables, and methods if you would like.

The input phrase could be as short as a single word, or as long as multiple sentences or paragraphs. Whitespace, capitalization, and punctuation should be honored and maintained in your final answer.

#### Examples

1) "pig" => "ig-pay"
2) "pig latin" => "ig-pay atin-lay"
3) "Pig Latin" => "ig-Pay atin-Lay"
